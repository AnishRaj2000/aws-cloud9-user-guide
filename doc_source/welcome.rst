What Is |AC9long|?

    :description:
        Introduction to AWS Cloud9.

|AC9| contains a collection of tools that you use to code, build, run, test, debug, and
release software in the cloud. To work with these tools, you use the 
|AC9| integrated development environment, or :dfn:`IDE`.

You access the |AC9IDE| through a web browser. The |IDE| offers a rich code-editing experience with
support for several programming languages and runtime debuggers, as well as a built-in
terminal. 
You can configure the |IDE| to your preferences. You can switch color themes, bind shortcut keys,
enable programming language-specific syntax coloring and code formatting, and more.

You use the |IDE| to interact with an |envfirst|. An :dfn:`environment` is a place where you store your project's files and where you run the tools to develop your apps. 
In the background, you can instruct |AC9| to have |EC2| launch an |EC2| instance and then connect the |env| to the newly-launched instance. 
We call this type of setup an :dfn:`EC2 environment`. 
You can also instruct |AC9| to connect an |env| to an existing |EC2| instance or your own server. We call this type of setup an :dfn:`SSH environment`. 

You can create and switch between multiple |envplural|, 
with each |env| set up for a specific development project. By storing the |env| 
in the cloud, your projects no longer need to be tied to a single computer or server setup. This
enables you to do things such as easily switch between computers and more quickly onboard developers to your team.

   :alt: Diagram that provides an overview of how AWS Cloud9 works

You use the |AC9IDE|, running in a web browser on your local computer, to interact with your |env|. An |EC2| instance
or your own server connects to the |env|. An :dfn:`environment` is a place where you store your project's files and where you run the tools to develop your apps.

You use the |AC9IDE| to work with files in the |env|. You can:

* Store these files locally on the instance or server.
* Clone a remote code repository |mdash| such as a repo in |ACClong| |mdash| into your |env|.
* Work with a combination of local and cloned files in the |env|.

About Cloud9 Versions
=====================

There are currently two versions of Cloud9 available: c9.io and |AC9long|. This :title:`AWS Cloud9 User Guide` only covers |AC9long|.

c9.io is available only to existing c9.io users. For more information, 
see `Cloud9 now runs on and integrates with AWS <https://c9.io/announcement>`_ on the c9.io website.
